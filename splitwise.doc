**Splitwise Clone Development Plan**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for developing a web application that closely mirrors the functionality of Splitwise, a popular expense-sharing platform. The application will be built using Python with the Django framework for the backend, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript for the frontend, and hosted on Vercel.

**2. Core Features**

* **User Authentication**
    * Secure user registration and login using Django's built-in authentication system or `django-allauth`.
    * Ability for users to connect with friends (potentially with social media integration).
* **Expense Management**
    * Creation, editing, and deletion of expenses.
    * Assignment of expenses to multiple users with varying shares (percentage or fixed amounts).
    * Categorization of expenses (e.g., food, travel, entertainment).
    * Option to attach images or receipts to expenses.
* **Group Management**
    * Creation and management of groups for shared expenses.
    * Different permission levels for group members (e.g., admin, regular member).
* **Settlements**
    * Calculation of balances between users.
    * Options for settling up (e.g., cash, bank transfer, online payment gateways).
    * Tracking of settlement history.
* **Notifications**
    * Notifications for new expenses, settlements, and other events (consider Django Channels for real-time notifications).

**3. Technical Specifications**

* **Backend (Python/Django)**
    * **Models:**  Define Django models for users, groups, expenses, and settlements using Django ORM.
        * **User:** `username`, `email`, `password`, `friends` (ManyToManyField to self)
        * **Group:** `name`, `members` (ManyToManyField to User), `creator` (ForeignKey to User)
        * **Expense:** `amount`, `description`, `category`, `payer` (ForeignKey to User), `group` (ForeignKey to Group), `date`, `image` (ImageField)
        * **ExpenseShare:** `expense` (ForeignKey to Expense), `user` (ForeignKey to User), `share` (DecimalField)
        * **Settlement:** `payer` (ForeignKey to User), `payee` (ForeignKey to User), `amount`, `date`
    * **Views:**  Implement views for handling user requests, data processing, and rendering templates.
        * `create_expense`, `edit_expense`, `delete_expense`, `create_group`, `add_friend`, `settle_up`, etc.
    * **Templates:** Use Django's template engine to create dynamic HTML pages.
    * **Forms:**  Utilize Django's forms framework for user input and validation.
    * **REST API:** Develop a REST API using Django REST framework to facilitate frontend interaction.
* **Frontend (Tailwind CSS, JavaScript)**
    * **Component-Based Structure:**  Build reusable UI components using React, Vue.js, or plain JavaScript.
    * **State Management:**  Choose a state management solution like Redux, Vuex, or Zustand if necessary.
    * **User Experience:**  Prioritize a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.
* **Hosting (Vercel)**
    * **Deployment:**  Follow Vercel's documentation for Django deployment.
    * **Serverless Functions:**  Consider using serverless functions for tasks like sending emails or image processing.

**4. Development Roadmap**

* **Phase 1:  Backend Development**
    * Set up Django project and configure settings.
    * Design and implement database models.
    * Develop core views and API endpoints.
    * Write unit and integration tests.
* **Phase 2:  Frontend Development**
    * Design and implement UI components.
    * Integrate with the backend API.
    * Implement user authentication and authorization.
    * Focus on user experience and responsiveness.
* **Phase 3:  Testing and Deployment**
    * Conduct thorough testing (unit, integration, and user acceptance testing).
    * Deploy the application to Vercel.
    * Monitor performance and address any issues.

**5. Technology Stack**

* **Backend:** Python 3, Django 4, Django REST framework, PostgreSQL (or your preferred database)
* **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (with optional framework like React or Vue.js)
* **Hosting:** Vercel
* **Version Control:** Git

**6. Future Enhancements**

* **Mobile App:**  Develop a mobile app using React Native or Flutter.
* **Advanced Features:**  Explore features like recurring expenses, expense reminders, and budgeting tools.
* **Internationalization:**  Support multiple languages and currencies.
* **Accessibility:**  Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.

**7. Conclusion**

This plan provides a solid foundation for developing a comprehensive Splitwise clone. By following a structured approach, leveraging the chosen technologies, and prioritizing user experience, the project can achieve its goals and deliver a valuable expense-sharing solution.

**Remember:** This is a template. You'll need to fill in the specific details, code examples, and design choices based on your project requirements and preferences. You can then copy this content into a document editor and export it as a PDF. Good luck!

Expesne delete
- get all balance and reduce the amount of ExpenseShare 
- add the balance in payer of expense
